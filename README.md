> **"In the market, Sentiment is the Seed; Alpha is the Karma."**

> **"Quantity becomes Quality."** — Processing 16.8 Million Tweets to challenge the Efficient Market Hypothesis.

## 📖 Executive Summary

**Project Karma** is a structural quantitative framework engineered to navigate the "Quantitative Impossible Trinity" (High Return, Low Drawdown, High Capacity) within the volatile Bitcoin ecosystem.

The core axiom of the project is that **market price is the 'Karma' (result), while collective human sentiment is the 'Seed' (cause).** Unlike traditional models that dismiss retail sentiment as chaotic noise, this engine utilizes a **RoBERTa-based Transformer pipeline** to distill 16.8 million data points into a high-fidelity "Viral Sentiment" factor.

The architecture achieves **Antifragility** by synchronizing two distinct market dimensions:

- **The Micro-Stoic (Precision):** A high-frequency sentiment pulse-checker that exploits short-term momentum. It remains indifferent to market panic, capturing alpha where others see only chaos.
- **The Macro-God (Providence):** A low-frequency regime-shift filter ($MA_{60} / MA_{100}$). It acts as the "Divine Hand," authorizing aggressive leverage during confirmed secular bull runs while deploying a **"Hybrid Sentiment Fuse"** to vanish into cash before systemic collapses.

By aligning **Macro-Regime Awareness** with **Micro-Psychological Resonance**, Project Karma transforms raw social entropy into a disciplined, 1,173x alpha-generating engine.

## 🏆 The Final Verdict: Performance Matrix (2013-2019)

| **Metric** | **Benchmark (BTC)** | **V5 Stoic (Baseline)** | **V5 Max (Berserker)** | **V6 Karma (God Engine)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic Core** | Buy & Hold | Trend Following | **High Leverage (2.0x)** | **Hybrid Resonance** |
| **Total Return** | 5,597.8% (55x) | **25,320%** (253x) | <span style="color:orange">**51,176%**</span> (511x) | <span style="color:purple">**117,395%** (1,173x)</span> |
| **Max Drawdown** | <span style="color:red">-84.2%</span> | -66.91% | <span style="color:orange">**-58.75%**</span> | **-65.50%** |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | 1.20 | 1.66 | **1.81** | **1.82** |
| **Calmar Ratio** | 0.66 | 3.78 | 8.71 | **17.92** |
| **Risk Character** | Passive Market | Conservative | **Aggressive & Fragile** | **Antifragile** |

> **Analyst Note:** > **V6 Karma** introduces the *Hybrid Fuse*. While V5 Max was forced to exit completely during shocks (the "Hard Deck"), Karma shifts gears, capturing the rebounds that mechanical strategies miss.

## 🧬 Strategy Architecture

The engine operates on a 5-Gear Transmission system, adjusting exposure based on the resonance between Price Structure and Crowd Psychology.

* **⚙️ Gear 0 (0.0x) - Hard Fuse:** `Bear Market` + `Panic` -> **Cash is King.**
* **⚙️ Gear 1 (0.5x) - Smart Base:** `Bull Market` + `Sentiment Dip` -> **Defensive Long.**
* **⚙️ Gear 2 (1.0x) - Standard:** `Bear Market` + `Trend Up` -> **Reversion Play.**
* **⚙️ Gear 3 (1.2x) - Resonance:** `Bull Market` + `Sentiment Up` -> **Aggressive Growth.**
* **⚙️ Gear 4 (1.8x) - God Mode:** `Bull Market` + `Nitro Sentiment` -> **Maximum Alpha.**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Engineering

* **ETL Engine:** `Polars` (Rust-based DataFrame) for high-performance processing of 16.8M rows.
* **NLP Core:** `RoBERTa-based Transformer` / `VADER` (Optimized) for sentiment scoring.
* **Backtest:** Custom vector-based backtesting engine (No loops, pure `NumPy`/`Pandas` vectorization).
* **Anti-Scam:** Regex-based "Anti-Scam v2.0" filter to purge bot networks and "Giveaway" spam.
